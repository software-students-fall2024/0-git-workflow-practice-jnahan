### What I find interesting
I decided to read this article because I've been interested in starting a side business for fun. I liked that the author, Brian Jenny, stayed persistent and kept trying new business ideas despite failing a few times. He broke down starting a side business into four steps: researching, making an offer they can't refuse, leveraging social media, and experimenting with ads. I appreciated that he emphasized the importance of consistency over intensity.

I also found it interesting that, unlike many articles that idealize entrepreneurship, Brian Jenney had a more pragmatic perspective. He stated, "There is a lot of money to be made as a software engineer and itâ€™s a hell of a lot more straight forward." I think this realistic outlook emphasizes that a side business should be driven by other motivating factors like passion, community, and desire to make a meaningful contribution, rather than just monetary motivations.

* Leo Bernarbezheng's comment: I found this article interesting because I've also been interested in starting a business to earn some side money, although I don't have a main job yet. Reading this article made me understand a little more about the thoughts that go behind an online business, especially concerning ads and tech stack. I'm thinking about starting a little business with my friends and we've realized that if we really want our service to be successful, we'd have to make sure our product is seen by others, especially our target audience.
